How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

User needs come in many forms, and creating user stories provide one specific approach that helps to convey the workflows and spefic motivations into an easily assimilated format.  This ensures the developer knows the goal of a requirement rather than just having a cold requirement that can be mis-interpretted or even morphed thru requirements grooming.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I have not had a specific need to develop a program at the scales that this course has utlized.  I can see where having a larger team these agile approaches makes sense, and this approach feels much more inviting than the old pseudo-code style of having everything mapped out at a high level and perpetually drilling down to refine the specifics as the need arises.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
I think being a good team member first must come from well documented code, end-stop.   

Beyond the well documented code, making your code highly readable is the next key factor; Just because you can write an entire function into a single working line of code using a bunch of abstractions, defaults, etc, doesn't mean the next person has any clue what you have done and it can take extensive time to untangle the single line of code, while using a few more lines of simpler code, with typed out values (even if they are the default)  makes everything easier to read and understand.

Next in the queue will be ensuring your code is well tested and maintainable.  I prioritize this as number 3 as bugs will always exist, and numbers 1 and 2 above will allow others to work thru them and apply patches as required, and having good documentation can even help to convey why something is the way it is and is in fact not a bug for a specific corner case that could be easily overlooked.
